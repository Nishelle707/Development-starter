    Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) 
    is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually
     round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough 
     topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions,
      olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked
       at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
       [1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

        Pastry is a baked good made from a dough of flour,
         fat, and water, known for its flaky or crumbly texture due
          to its high fat content. It can be sweet or savory and 
          is used to make a wide variety of items like pies, tarts, croissants, and turnovers.
